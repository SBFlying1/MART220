I chose not to use generative AI for this assignment.

1) I did not use generative AI, but I did use Google Images to obtain the three images of my blackberries, croissant, and spaghetti.

2) It was the easiest option for me to access and to find what I was looking for.

3) My Google query was "(food item) transparent PNG", to keep each image consistent.

4) Yes, as each image I found was clear, had the food item front and center, was transparent, and was a PNG.

5) Each of the images added a bit of personal flair to the project, as the three are of my favorite foods overall. Also, the croissant teleporting and disappearing around the screen was fun to code!

(As a spoiler, the entire section after this has not changed and will never change unless I see it befitting to do so.)

I decided not to use generative AI for the reasons listed below, a list that, regardless of the assignment, will not change:

- Generative AI runs on clean water, which many communities, particularly those in droughts, need to survive
- Generative AI is often incorrect, and has been shown to fabricate information that it will add on to some prompts to make the responses appear more complete and interesting
- Using Generative AI for anything, in my opinion, simply makes the user look lazy and idiotic, since it only takes a couple extra clicks to find much more credible information that came from another human's legitimate, real brain, or a few dollars/a bit of effort to have a real human or even you yourself create anything that AI could
- Generative AI is being forced down everyone's throats, through things like multiple websites implementing it and there being no easy ways to remove its presence
- Generative AI has been found to steal art and stories from human artists and writers, without any given credit, to use for its own image and story generation capabilities
- Generative AI, if given enough leeway, could go on to fully replace humanity and render most of our populace down to people comparable to those in Idiocracy
- I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream

...amongst other things. In short, humanity can do so much, and the only reason AI should ever be used is for controlled, experimental settings to show how much lesser it is compared to anything a human could produce, and for absolutely nothing else. Not for fun and games, not for casual comparison, not for the purposes of a relationship, not to generate art or stories, not to fix up your writing, nothing.
